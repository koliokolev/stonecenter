    <p>During the ice age, sheets of ice extended from Canada into the northern half of the US.
        While these glaciers were moving south, they picked-up chunks of Canadian granite,
        rolling it under mile thick ice and deposited this rock in Wisconsin.
        Then as the ice sheets melted, huge amounts of melt water flowed over these
        granite chunks smoothing and rounding them further, making what
        is now known as the Wisconsin Cobble. These Cobbles, sometimes referred
        to as river rocks,fieldstone or granite boulders, are made of the now smooth and
        rounded granite. Ranging in size from a few inches to several feet across, they
        come in a mixture of colors, from a deep rose, to pink, buff, black and even white.
        Some are striped, some are spotted, and some even have swirls of different colors.
        Available in three sizes, these cobbles are great for ponds, borders and small
        retaining walls. Wisconsin Cobbles are an economical and easy way to
        enhance the beauty of your yard or garden.</p>

    <p>Pavers, sometimes referred to as interlocking pavers,
      are a concrete brick designed for in-ground use for the
      construction of patios, walks and driveways. This is a
      remarkable product! Made from a pressed concrete, it is
      incredibly strong, durable and easy to install.
      <br><br>
      We are proud to be able to offer you interlocking pavers
      from the top two manufacturers in the Midwest.
      <br><br>
      There are several very good reasons to use paving brick for
      your walk or patio other then its beauty and functionality.
      First, we live in an environment that has freezing and thawing.
      When the ground freezes, it expands and will move and heave your
      walk or patio. Solid structures like poured concrete will tilt or crack,
      leaving damage that is difficult if not impossible to repair.
      Paving brick float on their gravel base, as the ground freezes and
      expands, the individual brick can move upwards with no damage.
      When spring arrives and the ground thaws, the brick settle
      back into place with no cracks or breakage.
